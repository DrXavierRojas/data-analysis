# Template Minimal

This is a lightweight starter template for students or researchers starting a new data analysis project.

## ðŸ“¦ What's Included

- Minimal structure with `data/`, `plots/`, and `styles/`
- One working example plot (`fig1_sinewave.py`)
- Clean Matplotlib `.mplstyle` for easy reuse
- `requirements.txt` for quick setup

Use this to start real projects. Copy components from `template-full` as needed.
