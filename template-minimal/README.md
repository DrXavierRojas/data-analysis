# Research Analysis Starter

This is a minimal starter repository for reproducible academic data analysis.

## 🔧 Setup

Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Run Example

```bash
python plots/fig1_sinewave.py
```

This will save a PDF figure in `figures_dev/`.

## 📂 Structure

- `data/` — raw and processed data folders
- `plots/` — Python scripts for generating plots
- `styles/` — Matplotlib style sheets

This is a lightweight foundation for students or collaborators.
