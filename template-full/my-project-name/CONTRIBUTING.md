# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions from students, collaborators, and external researchers.

## 📐 Best Practices

- Every figure must be generated by a script.
- Use vector formats (`.pdf`) for paper figures.
- Always commit data with matching metadata where applicable.
- Structure projects clearly: `data/`, `plots/`, `papers/`
- Document scripts with clear headers and docstrings.
