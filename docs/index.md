# 🧪 Data Analysis Framework

Welcome to the `data-analysis` toolkit — a unified framework for reproducible academic research projects involving data analysis, figure creation, and LaTeX integration.

## 📁 Project Structure

This repository contains two reusable templates:

### [`template-full/`](../tree/main/template-full)
A complete, example-rich project including:
- Matplotlib and Plotly plotting
- Metadata logging
- LaTeX-ready outputs
- Style files and reproducibility tools

### [`template-minimal/`](../tree/main/template-minimal)
A clean scaffold for starting real projects with:
- Minimal requirements
- One example script
- Simple Matplotlib style

Use this to kick off any new research effort and scale up by copying elements from `template-full`.
